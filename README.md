# SDET Framework Lab
A collection of **mini test frameworks** and **design exercises** to practice and demonstrate automation skills for interviews.

## Goals
- Build small, production-style **UI and API automation frameworks** (Python + Playwright + pytest).
- Document **design patterns** (Page Object, fixtures, schema validation).
- Practice **system/test design exercises** (scalable QA strategies, CI/CD).
- Include **SQL validation scenarios** as part of test design.

## Structure (planned)
- `ui-playwright/` — Playwright UI framework with Page Objects, fixtures, reports.
- `api-pytest/` — API testing framework with client wrappers, schemas, mocks.
- `docs/` — Learning notes, test design exercises, SQL interview prep.

## Status
Currently starting with documentation. Code frameworks will be added step by step.
